# üç± Food Image Classification using Vision Transformer (ViT) in PyTorch

This project replicates the Vision Transformer (ViT) model from the research paper  
[**"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)  
and applies it to classify food images using PyTorch.

## üß† About the Project

Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have dominated image classification tasks for years. However, Transformers ‚Äî originally designed for NLP ‚Äî have shown competitive performance in vision tasks when applied correctly.

In this project:
- We implement the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** from scratch using PyTorch.
- We classify images from a food dataset a custom food image dataset.
- The model learns to identify different food categories based on visual patterns.
